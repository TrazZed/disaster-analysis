Analysis of Scientific Data from the EM-DAT Internation Disaster Database created by the Centre for Research of the Epidemiology of Disasters and CO2 Emissions data.

This repo aims to analyse and visualise global disaster data from EM-DAT and global $CO_2$ emissions data in order to draw conclusions from trends and propose potential causation effects. Python was used with several packages, including Pandas,
to analyse and visualise the data.
